I'm a bot that allows you to do a lot of things: moderation, mini-games, an xp system, statistics and many other super useful commands (and totally pointless ones)! 
You can start by typing `!help` in this chat to see the list of available commands, then `!config see` will let you see the configuration options (a website is in preparation). 

For helping me in the creation of the bot, my owner and I would like to thank Awhikax for his support during the various crises, Aragorn1202 for all his ideas and sentences full of good sense, Adri526 for all these beautiful logos, emojis and profile pics, and Pilotnick54 to review and correct my English!
