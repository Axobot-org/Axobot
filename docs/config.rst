=============
Server config
=============

Recently, ZBot has features that can be modified per server, to make each server unique. You will find the language of the bot, the activation of certain options (such as the xp system), the list of roles authorized to use certain commands (ban, clear...), the welcome messages, and many other options. 

The list of options continues to grow as development progresses, that's why a website is planned to make server configuration easier.

.. note:: For the curious, know that all the configuration of each server is entirely saved in a MySQL database file, which makes its use easier than a simple txt or csv file.

-----
Watch
-----

**Syntax:** :code:`config see [option]`

The `see` subcommand allows you to see the value of a configuration, with a mini explanatory sentence. If no option is specified, the entire configuration will be displayed in a single message. Note that the bot can suffer a slight latency since this data is stored in an external database.

A detailed list of all options is available `below <#list-of-every-option>`_ .

.. warning:: To display this command correctly, ZBot only needs Embed links permission.


------
Modify
------

**Syntax:** :code:`config change <option> <value>`

This subcommand allows you to modify the value of an option. Just enter the exact name of the option and its value. A validation message will then be sent if the request has been correctly executed. 

If the value contains several objects, such as a list of roles or channels, they must be separated by commas, like this: :code:`config change clear Admin, Moderators, Special role for Special people`.

.. note:: When the value takes the form of roles, for more comfort you are not obliged to mention them: the exact name or the identifier of the role is enough. The same goes for chanels.


------
Delete
------

**Syntax:** :code:`config del <option>`

This subcommand can be useful to reset an option to its default value. By executing this command, the option will be deleted and will take the same value as originally.
