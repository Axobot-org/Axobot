Check the XP of someone
-----------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rank [user]`

This command is used to view the number of xp, rank and level of a member. You can select this member either by mentioning it or by using his name or ID. If no user is given, your own XP will be displayed.

.. note:: The bot sends the format adapted to its permissions: if it can send files, it will display the xp card. If it can send embeds, it will display it in an embed, and otherwise by text.
