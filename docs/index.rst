Welcome to ZBot documentation!
==============================

Welcome to the **ZBot** bot documentation, a Discord bot coded in Python 3 by a small French developer, *Z_runner*. You will find in the documentation all the explanations on each of the usable commands, as well as the list of the last additions and some code examples. The documentation is currently in English but the bot is available in several languages, including its main language, French.

The `Moderation` section displays every command related to the moderation of a server: clear, slowmode, kick, ban... The `Minecraft` section allows you to discover all Minecraft related commands: item search or server check. The `Info` section is about commands that allow you to get information about members, roles, channels, server etc. The `Configuration` sections are a guide to allow you to correctly configure the bot on your server, or for yourself as user. The `Permissions` page allows you to put exactly the right permissions in the bot, nothing unnecessary or dangerous! `RSS` section is there to follow websites, YouTube/Twitter/Twitch channels and other feeds, without worrying about it. And other sections are continually being added!
