================================

Welcome to the **Axobot** documentation, a Discord bot coded in Python by a random French developer, *Z_runner*. You will find in the documentation all the explanations on each of the usable commands, as well as the list of the last additions and some code examples. The documentation is currently in English but the bot is available in several languages, including its main language, French.
