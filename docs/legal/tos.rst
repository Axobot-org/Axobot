================
Terms of Service
================

Axobot, as any verified Discord app, has its own terms of services, defining among other things how you should use our app and what to expect from us. We provide you with a translation of these terms here, but only as a guide. **This version cannot be used as a replacement for the original and official version**, available in French at https://zrunner.me/axobot-cgu.pdf.

Here is the unofficial translation of the December 2, 2022 version.


1. Object
---------

The purpose of this document (hereinafter the "**Terms of Service**") is to provide a legal framework for the terms and conditions under which the Axobot application (hereinafter "**Axobot**", "**we**", "**us**", "**our**") is made available to users (hereinafter the "**User(s)**" or "**you**") of the DISCORD platform.

Any natural person using Axobot acknowledges having fully understood these Terms of Service at the latest at the time of its implementation or use.

Axobot is available, in its official version, on the website https://zbot.readthedocs.io. It may also be accessible on mirror sites or referral sites.

The service(s) offered by Axobot (hereinafter the "**Service**") consist in the addition of additional functionalities to the DISCORD platform, all of which are detailed in the documentation available at https://zbot.readthedocs.io/. Therefore, the use of the Service requires the creation and use of an account on the DISCORD platform (hereinafter the "**User Account**").

**Since Axobot relies on the DISCORD platform, it is up to the User to find out about the General Terms of Service implemented by DISCORD (https://discord.com) and about any exceptions that these conditions might make to our General Terms of Service.**

**Axobot is an application that is made available to its Users for free. The User is advised that the support and maintenance of Axobot is carried out according to the free time of its developers and that no guarantee is given to the Users.**


2. Access to the Service
------------------------

The use of the Service is made only through the DISCORD platform, and must therefore respect its Terms of Service. In addition to these, the User undertakes, each time they use the Service, to behave in a normal and reasonable manner and not to hinder, in any way whatsoever, its proper functioning.

In particular, the user agrees not to:
   * Disrupt, slow down, block or alter the normal operation of the Service;

   * Fraudulently access, maintain, hinder or disrupt the access systems to the Service's features;

   * Use the Service for any dishonest or harmful purpose, including but not limited to harming another User, damaging the public image of the Service, or committing an illegal act.

Some features of the Service are available only within "servers", as defined in the Terms of Service of DISCORD. It is the responsibility of the managers of the said server to ensure the proper use of the Service within that server. In particular, the managers of the server undertake to put in place any security system necessary to prevent misuse of the Service by other members of the server. We cannot be held responsible for any damage caused by misuse of our Service.

The User shall inform us without delay if they notice a security breach, including any possibility of misuse of the Service's features for dishonest purposes, so that we can take appropriate action without delay to remedy the security breach. The contact email address is listed on the last page of these Terms of Service.

In the event of a security breach identified by our team, which could compromise the security of the Service or its use, we reserve the right to proceed, without prior notice, to a temporary or prolonged interruption of the Service in order to remedy the security breach as soon as possible.


1. Guarantee of service operation and liability
-----------------------------------------------

We use our best efforts to enable access to and use of the Service in accordance with the DISCORD Applications usage rules. However, we cannot guarantee that the Service will be free of anomalies, errors or bugs, or that these can be corrected, or that the Service will function without interruption or failure, or that it will be compatible with all methods of using the DISCORD platform.

The Service is intended to be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except in cases of force majeure or the occurrence of an event beyond our control and with the reserve of possible breakdowns and maintenance interventions necessary for the proper functioning of the Service. In particular, we can not be held responsible for a temporary stop of our Service caused by a partial or complete failure of DISCORD or our host. The maintenance interventions may be carried out at any time without prior notice to the User.

In this respect, the User acknowledges that use of the Service is at their own risk; the Service is accessible to them "as is" and depending on its availability. It is also the responsibility of the User to take all necessary measures to ensure that the technical characteristics of his equipment allow him to use the Service, in particular by ensuring that he uses a sufficiently recent version of DISCORD.

Consequently and within the limits authorized by law, we cannot be held responsible for any type of foreseeable or unforeseeable damage, material or suffered by the User and arising from the use or total or partial impossibility of using the Service.

The User is also encouraged to contact our support team if they encounter any difficulties in using our Service.


4. Intelectual property
-----------------------

All copyright, design rights, trade dress and trademarks and all other intellectual property rights in any materials or information developed or created by us in connection with the Service shall remain our exclusive property under all circumstances. Nothing in these Terms of Service or in the content of the Service shall be construed as granting, directly or by implication, any license or right other than to use the Service. However, the source code of the Service is subject to its own license, provided in the same place as the source code.


5. Hypertext links
------------------

The Service may contain links to other websites, over which we have no control. In spite of the prior and regular checks that we carry out, we decline all responsibility for the content that may be found on these sites.
The same applies to any information or page presented by DISCORD about or in connection with our Service.


6. Support provided
-------------------

We implement several solutions to provide the User with assistance in using the Service. In particular, a complete documentation of the public features of the Service is available at https://zbot.rtfd.io and is kept up to date as much as possible. User may also contact us through our support server (whose invitation link is https://discord.gg/N55zY88), our GitHub repository (at https://github.com/ZRunner/Axobot), or as a last resort by email (at z.runner.mc@gmail.com).

Despite our best efforts, we cannot guarantee that the User will receive a satisfactory response to their requests, whether it is a request for help with their use of the Service, a suggestion for improvement, a bug report, or any other interaction with support. This support is offered on a voluntary basis by each participant, and we cannot be held responsible for any incompleteness, inaccuracy or lack of response to the User, or for any consequences thereof.


7. Modifications to this document
----------------------------------

We reserve the right to update our Terms of Service from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service on this page.

You should review these Terms of Service periodically for any changes. Changes to these Terms of Service become effective when they are posted on this page.

8. Competence
-------------

The interpretation and execution of the present General Terms of Service, as well as all acts that would be the result or consequence, will be subject to French law, regardless of the place of use of the Service, the nationality of the User and his address.

Any dispute resulting from the present and/or from any use of the Service which will be addressed to us will be subjected to the exclusive competence of the competent Court of Paris even in the event of appeal in guarantee or of plurality of defendants or of incidental demand.
