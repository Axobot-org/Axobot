More and more bots offer the feature to follow news feeds, sometimes `RSS feeds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>`__, but most often YouTube channels or Reddit communities. Axobot allows you to track any RSS/atom feed, as well as any YouTube/Twitch/DeviantArt channel.

With this bot you have two possibilities to follow a feed: manually request the last post, or configure an automatic follow-up in a text channel. In the case of automatic tracking, Axobot will scan all feeds every ten minutes to check for new posts, sending them in if there are any. Just be careful: this automatic tracking costs a lot of resources to the bot, so you are limited to 10 automatic feeds per server!

To manage this plugin (add, edit or remove feeds), you will need at least the Manage Server permission.

-----------------
See the last post
-----------------

**Syntax:** :code:`last-post <name|link> [youtube|twitch|deviant|web]`

This command allows you to see the last post of a youtube channel, a user on Twitch or DeviantArt, or from any valid RSS feed. If you provide a full URL, the bot will automatically detect the type of feed. If you only provide the name of the channel, you will have to specify the type of feed.

.. note:: No specific permission is required for this command. Remember to allow the use of external emojis to get a prettier look.


-------------
Follow a feed
-------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss add <link>`

If you want to automatically track an rss feed, this command should be used. You can only track a maximum feeds, which will be reloaded every 20 minutes. Note that Minecraft server tracing also counts as an rss feed, and therefore will cost you a slot (which are currently limited to 10 per server).

For YouTube channels, simply give the link of the channel, so that the bot automatically detects the type and name of the channel. If no type is recognized, the 'web' type will be selected.

.. note:: To post a message, the bot does not need any specific permission. But if it's a Minecraft server feed (see the `corresponding section <minecraft.html>`__), don't forget the "`Read message history <perms.html#read-message-history>`__" permission!


--------------
See every feed
--------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss list`

If you want to keep an eye on the number of rss/Minecraft feeds registered on your server, this is the command to use. The bot will search in the depths of its incomprehensible files to bring back the list of all the feeds, and summarize them for you in a nice embed.

.. warning:: The bot needs "`Embed Links <perms.html#embed-links>`__" permission!


--------------
Mention a role
--------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss set-mentions [feed ID] [silent] [roles]`

This rss feed tracking option allows you to notify a role when a new post arrives. The roles mentioned are different between rss feeds, which allows you a greater handling.

The "feed ID" argument is the identifier of the feed (found with the command `rss list <#see-every-feed>`__). If you do not enter this argument, or if the feed can't be found, the bot will open a menu where you can choose which feed to modify. Then another menu will allow you to choose which roles you want to mention.

The "silent" argument allows you to set the messages as silent. When this option is enabled, mentions will still appear for your users, but they will no longer receive push notifications when the message is sent. This is the same way it works when you send a message starting with @silent. Default is "false" (disabled).

The "roles" arguments is the list of roles you want to mention, separated by spaces (if some of them contains spaces, you can use quotations "..." instead). If not specified, Axobot will ask you for the list. You can either use names or IDs, or put "none" to remove every mention.

.. warning:: For this command too, the bot needs "`Embed Links <perms.html#embed-links>`__" permission!


---------------
Change the text
---------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss set-text [feed ID] [new text]`

This command is particularly useful if you want to change the text of an rss feed tracking, for example to have a customized text, or in your native language. Many tools are at your disposal (also known as *variables*) that allow an optimal personalization of the message. That's right, we thought of you.

If the rss feed ID is not given, the bot will open a menu to select it. And for the text, if you have forgotten it, the bot will also ask you to know it, and will provide you the current text and a list of the usable variables.

.. note:: Available variables are:

    - :code:`{author}`: the author of the post
    - :code:`{channel}`: the channel name (usually the same as author)
    - :code:`{date}`: the post date, using the Discord date markdown
    - :code:`{long_date}`: the post date in UTC, using extended static format
    - :code:`{timestamp}`: the `Unix time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`__ in seconds, usable in `Discord timestamp markdown <https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting-timestamp-styles>`__
    - :code:`{link}` or :code:`{url}`: a link to the post
    - :code:`{logo}`: an emoji representing the type of post (web, YouTube, Reddit...)
    - :code:`{mentions}`: the list of mentioned roles
    - :code:`{title}`: the title of the post
    - :code:`{full_text}`: the full text of the post
    - :code:`{description}`: the description/summary of the post

.. warning:: Hey guess what? For this command, the bot needs "`Embed Links <perms.html#embed-links>`__" permission!


-----------
Move a feed
-----------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss move [feed ID] [new channel]`

If you want to move an rss feed without having to delete it, recreate a new one and then reconfigure it, you can use this command. It can also be useful to configure a feed in a secret chat room, then reveal it to your entire server without having to temporarily close your chat!

If no identifier is given, the bot will ask you which one to modify.  As for the channel, if you do not specify any, it will select the one in which you type the command.


------------------
Setup a feed embed
------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss set-embed [feed ID] [use embed]` or :code:`rss set-embed <feed ID> [use embed] <parameters>`

Sometimes people want to have a lot of control over what is happening in the world. Since we are unable to offer it to them, we offer you a great control on the embeds sent by rss feeds. The first command allows you to enable the use of embed instead of classic text, the second one allows you to choose a title, a color and a custom footer.

For the first command, if you do not give the feed identifier or a boolean value, the bot will ask you for it. However, you must give it yourself for the second command (you can find it via the `rss list <#see-every-feed>`__ command).

The available parameters are:

- color: The color of the embed (eg. #FF00FF)
- author-text: Text displayed in the author field of the embed (max 256 characters), or 'none' to disable it
- title: Embed title (max 256 characters), or 'none' to disable"
- footer-text: Small text displayed at the bottom of the embed (max 2048 characters), or 'none' to disable"
- show-date-in-footer: Whether to show the post date in the footer or not
- enable-link-in-title: Whether to enable the link in the embed title or not
- image-location: Where to put the image in the embed (thumbnail, image, or None)


-------------------
Filter a feed posts
-------------------

**Syntax** :code:`rss set-filter <feed ID> <blacklist|whitelist> [words]` or :code:`rss set-filter <feed ID> <none>`

This command allows you to filter the posts of a feed, to only send the ones that contain specific words. You can either use a blacklist, to block posts that contain at least one of the sepcified words, or a whitelist, to only send posts that contain at least one of the specified words. Axobot will then check each new post title and tags, and will only send it if it matches the filter.

The "feed ID" argument is the identifier of the feed (found with the command `rss list <#see-every-feed>`__ or via autocompletion). The words argument is the list of words you want to filter, separated by commas (:code:`,`).

Using the "none" argument will disable the filter for this feed.


------------------
Test a feed format
------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss test [feed ID]`

If you want to test the format of a feed, this command is for you. It will send you a message with the current format of the feed, so you can see if it suits you or not. If you want to change it, you can use the `rss set-text <#change-the-text>`__ or `rss set-embed <#setup-a-feed-embed>`__ commands. This command will also allow you to check that your feed URL is working correctly; if not, you'll receive an error message.

The message sent will use the last post of the selected feed, and will follow exactly the configuration of text, embeds and mentions set up for this feed. Note, however, that role mentions will be disabled to avoid actually mentioning your members.

If you do not specify the feed ID, the bot will ask you for it.


----------------------
Delete a followed feed
----------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss remove [feed ID]`

With this command, you can stop following an rss/minecraft feed. And it's also very easy to use. Just one command and *poof*, we shut down the machinery.

The "feed ID" argument is the identifier of the feed (found with the command `rss list <#see-every-feed>`__). If you do not enter this argument, or if the feed can't be found, the bot will open a menu where you can choose which feeds to delete.


------------------------
Enable or disable a feed
------------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss enable [feed ID]` or :code:`rss disable [feed ID]`

Sometimes you may want to temporarily disable a feed, without actually deleting it. This command provides an easy way to do this, as the bot won't post new messages from disabled feeds but will still allow you to re-enable it at any time.

This command can also be useful to re-enable a feed that has automatically been disabled by the bot, which can happens when you misconfigured it or if the website is down for too long.

The "feed ID" argument is the identifier of the feed (found with the command `rss list <#see-every-feed>`__). If you do not enter this argument, or if the feed can't be found, the bot will open a menu where you can choose which feeds to enable/disable.

.. warning:: Disabled feeds still count in your server feed count, so disabling a feed won't allow you to add more feeds if you have already hit the max count!


-----------------
Reload every feed
-----------------

**Syntax:** :code:`rss refresh`

If your favorite YouTube channel has just posted a new cool video, and the bot takes too long to post it in your specially designed channel, you can force it to refresh the list of your subscribed feeds, in addition to Minecraft servers. This command will allow you in a few seconds to be again at the top of the latest news!

.. note:: Note that to avoid lags, a 10-minute cooldown is active on this command.
