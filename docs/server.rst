‚öô Server configuration
=======================


--------------
Config options
--------------


Recently, Axobot has features that can be modified per server, to make each server unique. You will find the language of the bot, the activation of certain options (such as the xp system), the list of roles authorized to use certain commands (ban, clear...), the welcome messages, and many other options.

The list of options continues to grow as development progresses, that's why a website is planned to make server configuration easier.


Watch
-----

**Syntax:** :code:`config see [option | page]`

The `see` subcommand allows you to see the value of a configuration, with a mini explanatory sentence. If no option is specified, the entire configuration will be displayed in a single message. Note that the bot can suffer a slight latency since this data is stored in an external database.

The page number is used because the options are too numerous to be displayed on a single screen. They have therefore been grouped by page of 20, accessible via this number (default 1).

A detailed list of all options is available `below <#list-of-every-option>`__ .

.. warning:: To display this command correctly, Axobot only needs Embed links permission.


**Syntax:** :code:`config list`

This command will give you a list of all the bot configuration options, in case you are looking for a specific name, or if you just want to make sure you know them all. However, no details will be given, to know what these options are used for you will have to go to the documentation.


Modify
------

**Syntax:** :code:`config set <option> <value>`

This subcommand allows you to modify the value of an option. Just enter the exact name of the option and its value. A validation message will then be sent if the request has been correctly executed.

If the value contains several objects, such as a list of roles or channels, they must be separated by spaces, like this: :code:`config set noxp_channels general #commands`. Please note that not all configurations support multiple values (for example, it is not possible to have multiple levelup channels).

.. note:: When the value takes the form of roles, for more comfort you are not obliged to mention them: the exact name (as long as it doesn't contain spaces) or the identifier of the role is enough. The same goes for channels or emojis.



Delete
------

**Syntax:** :code:`config del <option>`

This subcommand can be useful to reset an option to its default value. By executing this command, the option will be deleted and will take the same value as originally.


List of every option
--------------------

* anti_caps_lock: Boolean indicating whether the bot should send a warning message when a message with too much capitalization is sent. Default is True.
* anti_raid: Anti-raid protection with some useful features. More information `here <moderator.html#anti-raid>`__. Default level: 0

The change takes place as soon as the order is validated by the system. Default :code:`fr`.
* leave: Message sent when a member leave your server. Some variables are usable, the same as for the welcome message.
* levelup_channel: Channel where the bot will send every levelup announcement message. It can be either a text channel, or "none" for no channel (Axobot won't send any levelup channel), or "any" if you want it in the same channel as the message. Default to any.

There is also a :code:`mee6-like` system, which uses the same rules as the MEE6 bot, and is also local. Default to :code:`global`.


---------------
Partners system
---------------

As a server grows, it is not uncommon to see partnerships formed with other servers. Some may even partner with bots. Axobot therefore offers a system to manage these partnerships in a clean and automatic way. Thanks to this system you can add, edit or remove partners in a few commands, and they will all be displayed in the same place, with the main information about them.

This information on partners is refreshed every 7 hours, starting at 1am (Paris time). It is currently impossible to reload the list yourself, only a Axobot administrator can do so.


Add a partner
-------------

**Syntax:** :code:`partners add <invite> [description]`

Allows you to add a server or bot to your partner list. The invitation must be either a server invitation (starting with discord.gg) or a bot invitation (discord.com/oauth). This invitation will be used to synchronize the partner, so make sure it does not expire.


Change the embed color
----------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`partners set-color <new color>`

Modifies the color of the partner embed, i. e. the color of the bar to the left of the presentations. An alias exists with the subcommand "colour".


Modify a description
--------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`partners set-description <ID> <new message>`

Adds or modifies the description of a partner. The identifier must be that of the partnership, obtainable via the command `partners list` or under the embed displayed in the partners' lounge.


Change a server invite
----------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`partners set-invite <ID> [new invite]`

It often happens that for X reason an invitation becomes invalid. Problem: Axobot uses the partner invitation to synchronize partners with the channel. There is therefore a command to quickly change the invitation of a server.

.. note:: If no new invitation is given in the command, the bot will send you the one currently in use.


List every partners
-------------------

**Syntax:** :code:`partners list`

Lists all the partners that your server currently has. The bot will display the name of the partner, the type (server or bot), and the date of addition. You will even have the list of servers that have added you as a partner!

.. warning:: For a better display of the list, it is recommended to give "`Embed Links <perms.html#embed-links>`__" permission to the bot.


Refresh your list
-----------------

**Syntax:** :code:`partners refresh`

Allows you to remove a partner from the list. You will be asked for a confirmation, to avoid misuse. Once a partner is removed, you must reconfigure it completely if you want to put it back into the channel.


Remove a partner
----------------

**Syntax:** :code:`partners remove <ID>`

Allows you to remove a partner from the list. You will be asked for a confirmation, to avoid misuse. Once a partner is removed, you must reconfigure it completely if you want to put it back into the channel.

-------------
Server backup
-------------

Axobot has a system to backup your server, saving your roles, channels, emojis, webhooks, icons, permissions, and much more. You will also find in this file the list of members and their permissions, although Axobot is not able to reinvite members if needed.  
This backup will avoid the most important damage, those little mistakes that can destroy your server as I myself experienced a few years ago. I hope to be able to save what is important to you.

When you load the backup, the bot may not be able to apply some changes. However, it will give you a complete list of what has and hasn't been changed so that you can fix it yourself.

.. warning:: The bot will need as many permissions as possible, which includes: `Manage roles <perms.html#manage-roles>`__, `Manage channels <perms.html#manage-channels>`__, `Manage webhooks <perms.html#manage-webhooks>`__, `Ban members <perms.html#ban-members>`__, `Manage expressions <perms.html#manage-expressions>`__.

Create a backup
---------------

**Syntax:** :code:`server-backup create`

Creates a file containing as much information as possible on your server, within the limit of the permissions granted to the bot. You will have to keep this file carefully, it will be necessary for you when you will want to restore the backup.

Load a backup
-------------

**Syntax:** :code:`server-backup load`

Uses the file attached to this message to load a backup, based on the data stored in the file. Be sure to send the file in the same message as the command, so that Axobot can easily find it. If the bot lacks permissions, it will try to skip this step and write it down in the logs. The set of logs is then sent at the end of the procedure.


------------------------
Voice channels managment
------------------------

Give a role to voice users
--------------------------

**Syntax** :code:`config set voice_roles <your roles>`

You can easily give a role to any member joining a voice channel, and revoke it when the member leave the channel. This allows you to create a specific text channel for people talking together, for example.

Create automated voice channels
-------------------------------

Managing a server isn't easy. You often have too many or not enough channels, especially voice channels. This is why the bot has an automated voice channels management system, which will create new voice channels when needed, and delete them when they aren't used anymore.

To do that, you only need to configure a special voice channel where every member joining it will trigger a new channel creation. This can be achieved with the :code:`config set voice_channel <your channel>` command.

Then, the bot needs to know where it should create these new channels. A simple :code:`config set voice_category <your category>` will ask the bot to create its new channels at the bottom of a specific category.

Axobot will take a random name for each new channel, from a random names API, but you can change the name format with the :code:`config set voice_channel_format <new format>` command. Several special keywords exists so you can get some unique names, feel free to use them in your format:

* :code:`{random}` inserts a random surname from randommer.io
* :code:`{minecraft}` inserts a random minecraft entity name
* :code:`{number}` inserts a random number
* :code:`{user}` inserts the Discord name and tag of the user who summoned the channel

If you have more ideas of variables to add, you can suggest them in our Discord support server!

.. warning:: Axobot needs the "`Manage channels <perms.html#manage-channels>`__", "`Move members <perms.html#move-members>`__" and "`Connect <perms.html#connect>`__" permissions in the selected category to create these news channels!

Clear your unusued auto channels
--------------------------------

Axobot will try to delete the channels automatically created once everyone left it. But if, for any reason, you still have some unusued auto voice channels, you can use the super :code:`voice-clean` command to start a big cleanup!

.. note:: Aynone with "`Manage channels <perms.html#manage-channels>`__" permission can use that command!
